# image_asset

A new Flutter project to add image to our app

## Points to ponder

- create a folder named images and add (image.jpg / image.jpeg / image.png or any other file ) to the folder.
- To use the image in the app ,go to pubspec.yaml
- Go to asset section and make following changes

```
     assets:
    - images/download.jpeg
```    
- Now the image can be used in the app
- Look up for the main.dart file for the rest of the code.
